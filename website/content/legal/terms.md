# Terms of Service

**Effective date:** October 9, 2025

These Terms of Service (“**Terms**”) are a binding agreement between you and **Animica Labs** (“**Animica**”, “**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”).  
They govern your access to and use of:

- The **Animica website** and associated content,
- **Studio Web** (browser IDE / simulator),
- **Explorer Web** (chain explorer),
- Public **RPC/WS** and status APIs,
- Client **SDKs** and open-source tools,
- Documentation and developer resources,
- Optional **wallet** software (browser extension / Flutter app), which is **self-custodial**.

If you do not agree to these Terms, **do not use** the Services.

---

## 1) Eligibility & Acceptance

By accessing or using the Services, you confirm that you:
- Are legally able to enter into these Terms in your jurisdiction;
- Will use the Services in compliance with these Terms and applicable law.

If you use the Services on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization, and “you” includes the organization.

---

## 2) Accounts & Security

Most Services can be used **without an account**. If you create an account (e.g., for newsletters or early access):

- You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date.
- You are responsible for all activities under your account and for safeguarding credentials.
- Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.

We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or pose risk to the Services.

---

## 3) Self-Custodial Wallets

Animica’s wallet software (extension or mobile/desktop) is **non-custodial**:

- **We do not hold or control your private keys, seed phrases, or funds.**
- **You** are solely responsible for backing up and securing keys/seed phrases.
- Lost keys/seed phrases **cannot** be recovered by Animica.
- Transactions are **irreversible** once submitted to network validators/miners.
- Wallet software may connect to public RPC/WS endpoints you choose; ensure you trust them.

---

## 4) Open Source & Content Licenses

- **Software**: Many components are open source and governed by their **repository licenses** (e.g., Apache-2.0, MIT). Where a repo includes a LICENSE file, that license controls for that code.
- **Site Content** (docs, blog, marketing pages) is provided under **CC BY 4.0**, unless otherwise noted.
- **Trademarks** (Animica name, logos, wordmarks) are proprietary; you may not use them without written permission.
- **Third-party** libraries are subject to their respective licenses.

---

## 5) Acceptable Use

You will **not**:

1. Attempt to exceed or circumvent **rate limits**, quotas, or access controls.
2. Interfere with or degrade the Services (e.g., **DoS**, abusive traffic, malicious payloads).
3. Misuse APIs (e.g., spam, scraping at scale without caching/backoff, credential stuffing).
4. Reverse engineer or probe non-public endpoints except where permitted by license or law.
5. Upload or link malware, phishing, illegal content, or infringing material.
6. Impersonate others or misrepresent your affiliation.
7. Use the Services for unlawful, deceptive, or fraudulent purposes.

**Operational note (APIs):** Public RPC/WS endpoints are shared resources. We may throttle, filter, or block traffic to protect reliability.

---

## 6) Fees & Changes

We may offer free and paid tiers. If fees apply:
- Pricing, billing intervals, and overage rules will be disclosed.
- We may change pricing on reasonable notice. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

Some Services may be **Beta/Experimental** and subject to additional terms or limitations.

---

## 7) Third-Party Links & Services

The Services may reference or integrate third-party sites, networks, node providers, or analytics tools. We do not control or assume responsibility for third-party services. Your use of those services is governed by their terms and privacy policies.

---

## 8) No Advice; Risk Disclosures

- The Services provide **developer tools and infrastructure**, not investment, legal, or tax advice.
- **Digital assets are volatile**. Protocols may experience bugs, forks, reorgs, or consensus failures.
- Transactions and smart contracts carry **risk of total loss** due to user error, key compromise, malicious contracts, or network issues.
- You are solely responsible for evaluating and assuming these risks.

---

## 9) Warranties Disclaimer

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Services are provided **“AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”**, **without warranties** of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that data will be accurate or preserved.

---

## 10) Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- **Animica will not be liable** for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenues, data, or goodwill, arising from or related to your use of the Services, even if advised of the possibility.
- Our **aggregate liability** for any claim relating to the Services will not exceed **US$100** or the amount you paid to us for the Service in the **three (3) months** preceding the event giving rise to the claim, whichever is greater.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in such cases, the limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted.

---

## 11) Indemnification

You will **defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** Animica and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Services, your content, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

---

## 12) Intellectual Property & Feedback

We and our licensors retain all rights in the Services. If you provide **feedback**, you grant Animica a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, sublicensable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate it without restriction or compensation.

---

## 13) Export, Sanctions & Compliance

You may not use or export the Services in violation of **U.S. export control laws**, **sanctions**, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. You represent you are not a prohibited party and will not enable access from embargoed regions in violation of applicable law.

---

## 14) Termination

We may suspend or terminate access (in whole or part) **at any time** if we reasonably believe you violated these Terms, pose security/operational risk, or as required by law. You may stop using the Services at any time. Sections that by nature should survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, limitations, indemnity, governing law) **survive termination**.

---

## 15) Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **State of California, USA**, without regard to conflict-of-law rules.

**Informal Resolution.** Before filing a claim, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by emailing **legal@animica.dev** within **30 days** of the issue.

**Arbitration & Venue (Individual Only).** If not resolved informally, disputes will be resolved by **binding arbitration** administered by JAMS in **San Francisco, California**, in English, unless you opt-out by emailing **legal@animica.dev** within **30 days** of first acceptance of these Terms. Either party may bring an individual action in small claims court in a competent venue.  
**Class Action Waiver.** Disputes must be brought **individually**, not as a class or representative action.

Consumers in jurisdictions that **do not allow mandatory arbitration** or class waivers retain the minimum rights required by local law.

We may update the Services and these Terms from time to time. We will post changes with a revised “Effective date.” **Continued use** after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
