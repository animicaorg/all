# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** October 9, 2025

Animica Labs (“**Animica**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy
describes how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you use:

- The **Animica website** (this site),
- **Studio Web** (browser IDE / simulator),
- **Explorer Web** (chain explorer),
- Public **RPC/WS** endpoints and status APIs,
- Documentation and developer resources.

Some products (e.g., on-chain nodes, SDKs, and open-source tools) are designed to operate without
collecting personal data. When we do process data, we do so with transparency and the least
amount necessary for functionality, security, and quality.

---

## 1) Information We Collect

### a) Information you provide
- **Contact details** (e.g., email) when you subscribe to a newsletter, request support, or apply for early access.
- **Content you submit** to forms (e.g., feedback, bug reports) and optional telemetry surveys.

### b) Automatically collected information
- **HTTP request metadata**: IP address, user-agent, referrer, and timestamps for basic security, anti-abuse, and reliability.
- **Product usage events** (opt-in only; see §6): page views, feature usage, and performance metrics.
- **Service logs** for RPC/WS and APIs: method name, success/failure, timing, and rate-limit counters.

We do **not** attempt to deanonymize users or enrich profiles with third-party data.

### c) Blockchain data
When you use Animica networks, transactions and addresses you broadcast are **public by design** and
replicated to network participants. This policy does not restrict how public blockchain data is used.

---

## 2) Cookies & Local Storage

We use a minimal set of cookies or local storage for:
- **Session state & preferences** (e.g., theme, network selection),
- **Security** (CSRF tokens where applicable),
- **Opt-in analytics** preferences (see §6).

We do not use third-party advertising cookies.

---

## 3) How We Use Information

We process data to:
- Provide and improve the website, Studio, Explorer, and APIs,
- Detect, prevent, and investigate abuse or security incidents,
- Measure reliability and performance,
- Communicate with you (e.g., updates, support),
- Comply with legal obligations.

Processing bases include **contract**, **legitimate interests**, **consent** (where required), and **legal compliance**.

---

## 4) Sharing & Disclosure

We do not sell personal information. We may share limited data with:
- **Service providers** (hosting, email delivery, analytics) under contracts that require confidentiality and data protection,
- **Security & anti-abuse vendors** to protect our services,
- **Law enforcement or regulators** when legally required,
- **Successors** in connection with a merger, acquisition, or similar event with appropriate protections.

---

## 5) Data Retention

- **Operational logs**: typically retained for **30–90 days** for reliability and security, then aggregated or deleted.
- **Account/Contact data**: retained while we have a business need or legal obligation (e.g., unsubscribe records).
- **Analytics events** (if enabled): retained per tool defaults or shorter, and may be aggregated.

We may retain derived, **non-identifiable** aggregates for research and product improvement.

---

## 6) Analytics (Opt-In)

We support privacy-respecting analytics (e.g., **Plausible**) and developer telemetry (e.g., **PostHog**) **only if you opt in**.
- When disabled, we do not send analytics events.
- When enabled, we avoid sensitive payloads and IP storage where tools allow.
- You can change your preference at any time via the site’s privacy controls.

---

## 7) Your Rights & Choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:
- Access, correct, or delete your personal data,
- Object to or restrict certain processing,
- Withdraw consent (where processing relies on consent),
- Port your data.

To exercise rights, contact **privacy@animica.dev**. We may need to verify your request.  
For **California residents** (CCPA/CPRA): we do not sell or share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.  
For **EEA/UK/Swiss** users (GDPR): Animica Labs acts as a controller for website accounts and communications.

---

## 8) International Transfers

We may process data in countries other than yours. Where required, we rely on
appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) to protect your information.

---

## 9) Security

We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards proportional to risk,
including encryption in transit, least-privilege access, and continuous monitoring.
No system is perfect; please report issues to **security@animica.dev**.

---

## 10) Third-Party Links

Our sites may link to third-party services (e.g., docs, videos, community tools).
This Policy does not cover those services. Review their privacy practices separately.

---

## 11) Children’s Privacy

Our services are intended for **adults and developers**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age required by local law. If you believe a child provided data, contact us for removal.

---

## 12) Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version here with a revised “Effective date” and, where appropriate, provide additional notice.
