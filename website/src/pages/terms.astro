    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of {ORG_NAME}
      websites, documentation, SDKs, software, wallets, and related services (collectively, the “Services”).
      By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      If you do not agree, do not use the Services.
    </p>

    <h2>1) Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You represent that you are legally capable of entering into these Terms and that your use complies
      with applicable laws in your jurisdiction. You may not use the Services if you are subject to any
      sanctions or on any restricted list applicable to {ORG_NAME}.
    </p>

    <h2>2) Non-custodial nature</h2>
    <p>
      The Services are non-custodial. {ORG_NAME} does not control your private keys, wallets, or funds,
      and cannot reverse on-chain transactions. You are solely responsible for safeguarding
      your keys, backing up seed phrases, and verifying transaction details before signing.
    </p>

    <h2>3) On-chain transactions & risk</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Blockchain activity is public and generally irreversible.</li>
      <li>Smart contracts may contain bugs or be exploited; use at your own risk.</li>
      <li>Asset prices are volatile; you may lose value.</li>
      <li>{ORG_NAME} does not provide investment, legal, or tax advice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Software licenses</h2>
    <p>
      Source code may be provided under open-source licenses indicated in the relevant repositories.
      To the extent any component is not open-sourced, {ORG_NAME} grants you a limited, revocable,
      non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Services in accordance with these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>When using the Services, you will not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Violate any law, regulation, or third-party right;</li>
      <li>Attempt to circumvent security, rate limits, or access controls;</li>
      <li>Deploy malware, spam, or engage in denial-of-service activity;</li>
      <li>Submit unlawful content or infringing materials;</li>
      <li>Impersonate others or misrepresent affiliation with {ORG_NAME}.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) APIs, rate limits, and third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      We may impose or adjust rate limits. The Services may link to or rely on third-party services
      (e.g., RPC providers, analytics, package registries). {ORG_NAME} does not control third-party services
      and is not responsible for their availability or behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our <InlineLink href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</InlineLink> describes how we handle information.
      By using the Services, you consent to the practices described therein.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
      {ORG_NAME} AND ITS CONTRIBUTORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
      LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
      WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR UNINTERRUPTED.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, {ORG_NAME}, ITS CONTRIBUTORS, AND AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE
      LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY
      LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES,
      EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF
      {ORG_NAME} EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) USD $100 OR (B) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO {ORG_NAME} (IF ANY)
      FOR THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
    </p>

    <h2>10) Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless {ORG_NAME} and its contributors from and against any
      claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from
      or related to your use of the Services or violation of these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Changes to the Services and Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may modify or discontinue parts of the Services at any time. We may update these Terms from time
      to time; material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date. Your continued use
      of the Services constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services immediately if we believe you have violated
      these Terms or applicable law. Upon termination, your right to use the Services ceases immediately,
      but sections intended to survive (e.g., Disclaimers, Limitation of liability, Indemnification,
      Governing law) will continue to apply.
    </p>

    <h2>13) Governing law & disputes</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of {JURISDICTION}, without regard to conflicts of law principles.
      The exclusive venue for disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be the
      courts located in {JURISDICTION}, unless otherwise required by applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>14) Export & sanctions compliance</h2>
    <p>
      You represent that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any
      country or person on any U.S., U.K., EU, or UN sanctions list, and you will not use the Services in
      violation of export control or sanctions laws.
