    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you use Animica websites, apps, SDKs,
      wallets, and related services (the “Services”), how we use it, and the choices you have. “We”, “us”,
      and “our” refer to the Animica project and maintainers.
    </p>

    <h2>1) What we <em>don’t</em> collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No private keys or seed phrases. Keys stay on your device or in your wallet.</li>
      <li>No contract source or user data from the on-chain execution unless you explicitly upload it to our services.</li>
      <li>No invasive device identifiers (we avoid fingerprinting).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) Information we may collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Basic telemetry</strong> (optional): anonymous performance metrics to improve reliability (e.g., load times, crash reports).</li>
      <li><strong>Web server logs</strong>: IP address, user-agent, referrer, and timestamps for security and abuse prevention. Logs are rotated and retained briefly.</li>
      <li><strong>Support messages</strong>: content you send to us (e.g., email, forms).</li>
      <li><strong>Newsletter</strong> (opt-in): email address; you can unsubscribe anytime.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics</strong> (opt-in): privacy-focused tools like Plausible/PostHog (cookie-free or minimal, if enabled).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Cookies & local storage</h2>
    <p>
      We prefer no or minimal cookies. Where needed (e.g., remembering theme, network selection, or session
      state), we use local storage or short-lived cookies. You can clear them in your browser settings.
    </p>

    <h2>4) How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To operate the Services (routing requests to RPC/WS endpoints, delivering docs and assets).</li>
      <li>To secure our infrastructure (rate limiting, DDoS mitigation, fraud prevention).</li>
      <li>To improve performance and user experience (aggregated, anonymized metrics).</li>
      <li>To communicate with you if you opt in (newsletter, critical notices).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Third-party processors</h2>
    <p>
      We may use reputable providers for hosting, analytics (opt-in), crash reporting, or email delivery. We
      require contractual safeguards and minimize data sharing. Current providers may be listed in our
      <InlineLink href="/humans.txt">humans.txt</InlineLink> or documentation.
    </p>

    <h2>6) Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      Server logs are retained for a short period (typically ≤ 30 days) unless needed to investigate abuse.
      Newsletter emails are kept until you unsubscribe or we close the list. Support messages are kept as
      long as reasonably necessary to address your request.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Your choices & rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Opt out of analytics in the UI (where available) or block via your browser.</li>
      <li>Unsubscribe from email via the link in the footer.</li>
      <li>Request deletion of support messages by contacting us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8) Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use transport encryption (HTTPS), least-privilege access, and defense-in-depth practices. Despite
      these measures, no system is perfectly secure—please handle secrets (seed phrases, private keys) with care.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Services are not directed to children under 13 (or the equivalent age in your jurisdiction). We do
      not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>10) International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Our infrastructure and providers may operate globally. Where required, we implement appropriate
      safeguards for cross-border data transfers.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be noted here with a new “Last updated”
      date. Your continued use of the Services after changes take effect indicates acceptance.
