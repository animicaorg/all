# Animica® Trademarks & Brand Usage

This page explains how to use the **Animica** name, wordmark, and logos (the “Marks”) in a way that protects the brand and avoids user confusion.

> **TL;DR:** Use “Animica” and the logo only to refer to the project itself or for truthful compatibility statements. Don’t imply endorsement, don’t stylize/alter the logo, and don’t ship products *as* “Animica” unless you have written permission.

---

## 1) What’s covered

- **Wordmarks:** “Animica”, “Animica Mainnet”, “Animica Testnet”, and related project names.
- **Logos & wordmarks:** Vector assets under `docs/assets/brand/` and `website/public/icons/`  
  - Primary lockups: `docs/assets/brand/logo.svg`, `docs/assets/brand/wordmark.svg`
- **Abbreviations & symbols:** References like “ANM” (token symbol) are not trademarks by themselves, but **must not** be used in a way that confuses users about origin or endorsement.

Unless otherwise stated, the Marks are trademark(s) of their respective holder(s) and are **not** licensed under Apache-2.0/MIT. All other code/content licenses remain unchanged.

---

## 2) Permitted uses (no permission needed)

You **may** use the Marks *nominatively* (to truthfully refer to the project) if you follow the rules below:

- **Compatibility statements:**  
  “Wallet X for Animica”, “SDK Y compatible with Animica”, “Runs on Animica Testnet”.
- **Descriptive references:**  
  Blog posts, documentation, academic papers, benchmarks, slides, and news coverage.
- **Links & navigation:**  
  Buttons like “Open in Animica Explorer”, deep links to Studio/Explorer.
- **Open-source forks (nominative only):**  
  You may say “a fork of Animica” in README/metadata; **you must remove the Marks** from the app name, icons, and UI. See §4.

**Rules for nominative use**
1. Use plain text “Animica” with correct capitalization.  
2. Do **not** use logos unless also complying with the **logo rules** in §3.  
3. Do **not** imply partnership, certification, or official status.  
4. Include a disclaimer where reasonable (see §6).

## 3) Logo & wordmark rules

When showing the official logo or wordmark files:

- **Do:**  
  - Use the provided, unmodified SVGs.  
  - Maintain clear space ≥ the height of the “A” around the mark.  
  - Use sufficient contrast; place on solid, calm backgrounds.  
  - Respect minimum size: ≥ 24 px tall for UI; ≥ 8 mm tall in print.

- **Don’t:**  
  - Alter colors, stretch, rotate, skew, animate, or add effects.  
  - Place on busy/low-contrast imagery or clash with other marks.  
  - Combine with your own logo into a single “lockup”.  
  - Create derivative icons or app badges that resemble the mark.

Official assets:  
`docs/assets/brand/logo.svg` · `docs/assets/brand/wordmark.svg`

## 4) Product & package naming

- **Allowed without permission:**  
  - “Foo for Animica”, “Bar (Animica Integration)”, “Baz — Animica Tools”
- **Not allowed without permission:**  
  - “Animica Foo”, “Animica Wallet”, “Animica Explorer” (first-party product names)  
  - Company names, domain names, or social handles starting with “Animica”

If you maintain a fork or distribution, choose a distinct name and icons. You **must not** suggest your build is the official one.

---

## 5) What’s not allowed (without prior written permission)

- Use of Marks in product names, logos, domain names, company names, social handles.  
- Co-branding that implies sponsorship, partnership, or certification.  
- Merchandise or commercial promotions using the Marks.  
- Any use in association with unlawful, deceptive, or harmful content (e.g., phishing, hate, malware, misleading token sales/NFTs).  
- Issuing tokens/coins **as** “Animica” or using the Marks to market unrelated assets.

---

## 6) Attribution & disclaimers

Where space allows, include a notice like:

> “Animica is a trademark of its respective holder. This project is not affiliated with and is not endorsed by the Animica project.”

In websites or docs, you may also add:

> “Logos and wordmarks used for identification only.”

## 7) Screenshots & UI captures

Screenshots of the official apps/sites are permitted for **informational** or **review** purposes, provided they are unmodified (except for cropping/redaction) and the use does not imply endorsement.

---

## 8) Enforcement & reporting misuse

We protect the Marks to prevent user confusion and phishing. If you see abuse or confusing usage, please report it:

- **Brand & legal:** `<legal@animica.org>`  
- **Security/phishing:** see `docs/security/RESPONSIBLE_DISCLOSURE.md`

We reserve the right to update these guidelines and to take action against misuse.

## 9) FAQ

**Q: Can I publish a wallet called “Animica Wallet X”?**  
A: No. Use “X Wallet for Animica” and your own distinct icon.

**Q: Can I ship a dapp with the Animica logo in the app icon?**  
A: No. You may show the logo *inside* the app when linking or indicating compatibility, but not as your app’s icon.

**Q: Can I register a domain like *animica-tools.example*?**  
A: No. Avoid domains that begin with or primarily feature “animica”. Use neutral names and clarify compatibility in page content.
