PLACEHOLDER-SPHINCS-SHAKE-128s-WASM
This is a placeholder file so the repository structure builds.
The MV3 loader will try to instantiate this and gracefully fall back
when it detects the module is not valid WASM with the expected C ABI.
Replace with a real SPHINCS+ (SHAKE-128s) WASM to enable fast verify/sign.
