PLACEHOLDER-DILITHIUM3-WASM
This is a placeholder file so the repository structure builds.
The MV3 loader will attempt to instantiate this and gracefully fall back
when it detects the module is not a valid WASM with the expected C ABI.
Replace with a real Dilithium3 WASM to enable fast signing/verification.
