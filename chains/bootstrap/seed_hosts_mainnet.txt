# Animica — Mainnet DNS Seed Hosts
# Status: placeholders until mainnet launch.
# One host per line. These should be stable, geo-distributed DNS seeds
# that resolve to a rotating subset of healthy full nodes.
#
# Guidelines:
# - Use dedicated subdomains; avoid pointing to a single IP.
# - Back seeders with multiple anycasted instances where possible.
# - TTL 60–300s recommended.
# - Monitor liveness and prune unhealthy backends automatically.

# Examples (commented out):
# seed1.mainnet.animica.dev
# seed2.mainnet.animica.dev
# seed3.mainnet.animica.dev
# community-seed.us.mainnet.animica.dev
# community-seed.eu.mainnet.animica.dev
# community-seed.ap.mainnet.animica.dev

# Add real seeds here prior to launch.
