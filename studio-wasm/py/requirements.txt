# Intentionally empty for Pyodide.
# The studio-wasm build ships with zero external Python deps to keep the
# browser payload minimal and portable.
#
# If you later need pure-Python packages that work in Pyodide, you can pin
# them here (avoid C extensions). Examples (uncomment to use if validated):
# cbor2==5.6.4     # Only if a pure-Python wheel is available for Pyodide
# typing-extensions==4.12.2
