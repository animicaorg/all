# This template is meant for local development of Python-VM contracts.
#
# Usage:
#   python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Notes:
# - Contracts are compiled to IR and executed in a deterministic VM; they don't
#   import chain libraries at runtime. The deps below are for *tooling*:
#   compilation, local simulation, tests, and linting.
# - If you are working inside the monorepo, you can install vm_py and the
#   Python SDK (omni_sdk) from local paths—see the "Local dev (optional)" block.
# - If/when vm_py and omni_sdk are published, you may swap in the pinned
#   package versions under "Published packages (optional)".

# Published packages (optional)
# Uncomment *when official packages exist* or you have access to a private index.
# These provide the Python VM compiler/runtime (vm_py) and the Python SDK

# Local dev (optional)
# If you have local source checkouts for vm_py and the SDK, install them
# in editable mode using absolute paths. Pick ONE of the forms below.
#
# Example (bash):
#   VM_PY_PATH="$(pwd)/../../vm_py"
#   SDK_PY_PATH="$(pwd)/../../sdk/python"
#   pip install -e "$VM_PY_PATH" -e "$SDK_PY_PATH"
#
# Or hardcode absolute paths (recommended for isolated environments):
# -e /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/vm_py
# -e /ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/sdk/python
#
# PEP 508 direct references (non-editable) also work:
# vm_py @ file:///ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/vm_py
# omni_sdk @ file:///ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/sdk/python
