# COMMUNITY GUIDELINES
_Moderation & anti-harassment policy for Animica spaces_

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Active  
**Scope:** All official Animica spaces — Git repositories, issues/PRs, discussions, forums/Discourse, chats (Telegram/Discord), calls, events, and social channels operated by the project.

These guidelines complement (not replace) contributor licenses, local laws, and other repo policies (see: `TRANSPARENCY.md`, `DEPOSIT_AND_REFUNDS.md`, `SLASHING_AND_RECOURSE.md`).

---

## 1) Principles

- **Build with respect.** Debate ideas, not people.  
- **No harassment.** Zero tolerance for demeaning, threatening, or unwanted behavior.  
- **Safety first.** Protect participants—especially newcomers and under-represented folks.  
- **Assume good intent;** respond to impact. We correct harm even if no harm was intended.  
- **Public by default,** private when safety or privacy requires it (see Transparency policy).  

---

## 2) Expected Behavior

- Be **welcoming, patient, and constructive.** Offer actionable feedback; cite sources or code.  
- **Use inclusive language.** Avoid slurs, stereotypes, and ableist/sexist/racist language.  
- **Respect boundaries.** Stop immediately if someone says “please stop,” “no,” or asks to move on.  
- **Disclose conflicts** relevant to proposals or vendor discussions (see `TRANSPARENCY.md`).  
- **Keep content on topic.** Channels have scopes; use correct threads/categories.  
- **Protect privacy.** Redact secrets/PII; follow security-reporting procedures for vulnerabilities.  

---

## 3) Unacceptable Behavior (Non-Exhaustive)

- **Harassment, hate, or discrimination** targeting protected characteristics or personal traits.  
- **Threats, intimidation, or encouragement of self-harm/violence.**  
- **Sexualized content or advances** in professional spaces; sexual commentary about individuals.  
- **Doxxing** (publishing or threatening to publish private info) or stalking.  
- **Trolling, brigading, or deliberate derailment** of discussions or votes.  
- **Spam, scams, impersonation, and deceptive behavior.**  
- **Malware or exploit drop-links;** distributing unvetted binaries in community channels.  
- **Off-topic NSFW content** (use clearly marked, opt-in channels if ever allowed).  

---

## 4) Content & Safety Rules

- **Security disclosures:** Use the responsible-disclosure process; never post 0-days publicly.  
- **AI/Quantum provider claims:** Marketing or performance claims must include reproducible evidence.  
- **Media assets:** Respect licenses; credit sources in `contrib/LICENSING.md` when applicable.  
- **Experimental code:** Label clearly; include risks and rollback instructions.  

---

## 5) Moderation Process

1. **Report** concerns via:  
   - `report@animica.dev` (email)  
   - Direct message to moderators (listed below)  
   - “Report” tools in forum/chat platforms  
2. **Triage:** Moderators acknowledge within **48 hours** (Sev-1 abuse within **24 hours**).  
3. **Assessment:** Review evidence (screenshots, links, logs), interview parties if needed.  
4. **Decision:** Apply an outcome from the Enforcement Ladder (below).  
5. **Record:** Summarize action in public minutes when safe (see `TRANSPARENCY.md`).  
6. **Appeal:** See §8.

**Current moderators (rotating):** add/update in `governance/ops/calendars/governance.md` and repo CODEOWNERS.

---

## 6) Enforcement Ladder (Examples)

- **E0 – Gentle nudge:** Private reminder; link to guideline.  
- **E1 – Public reminder:** Moderator note in thread; steer back on topic.  
- **E2 – Content action:** Edit/remove post; lock thread; move to correct channel.  
- **E3 – Cooldown:** Temporary mute/slow-mode (24–72h).  
- **E4 – Temporary ban:** Removal from space for 7–30 days; re-entry requires acknowledgment.  
- **E5 – Permanent ban:** For severe/serial abuse, credible threats, doxxing, or hate speech.  
- **E6 – Escalation to governance:** If abuse intersects proposals/votes, stewards may void tainted signals and sanction organizational accounts (see `SLASHING_AND_RECOURSE.md` for providers).

**Notes:**  
- We act on **impact**, not just intent.  
- Prior behavior informs severity.  
- Cross-platform evasion (sockpuppets) may escalate to E5.

---

## 7) Anti-Harassment & Vulnerable Situations

- **Targeted harassment:** Coordinate bans across channels; archive evidence.  
- **Dogpiling:** Apply rate-limits and thread locks; summary with action items only.  
- **Impersonation:** Require proof of identity (signed message or known handle linkage).  
- **Minors:** No participation in adult topics; stricter privacy and consent standards.

---

## 8) Appeals

- File within **14 days** of a moderation decision.  
- Appeals are reviewed by a **separate moderator** or a small panel not involved in the original action.  
- Provide new context or demonstrate error/misidentification.  
- Outcomes: uphold, reduce, or revoke. Public summary when safe.

---

## 9) Coordination with Law & Platform Rules

We comply with applicable laws and platform terms. Imminent threats, credible violence, or CSAM reports may be escalated to platforms and authorities. We will preserve relevant logs where lawful.

---

## 10) Transparency & Record-Keeping

- Major actions (E3+) are summarized in weekly notes (dates, channels, rule violated, anonymized if needed).  
- Redactions follow `TRANSPARENCY.md` §7 (who, why, scope, sunset date).  

---

## 11) Contributor / Maintainer Responsibilities

- Model expected behavior; redirect unproductive debate.  
- Use issue/PR templates; convert opinion debates into factual checklists.  
- Prefer “request changes” with concrete steps.  
- Hand off moderation if personally involved or conflicted.

---

## 12) Safe Participation Tips

- Mute individuals or keywords; ask moderators for help early.  
- Keep interactions in public channels when feasible.  
- Use content warnings for potentially sensitive materials.

---

## 13) Amendments

Changes to these guidelines require a governance PR. Material updates are announced in community channels and recorded in CHANGELOG.
