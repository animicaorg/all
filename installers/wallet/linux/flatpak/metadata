# Flatpak "metadata" file (INI-style). Useful for debugging single-file bundles
# or when inspecting an exported build. flatpak-builder will normally generate
# this automatically; we keep a canonical copy here for reference/tools.
#
# NOTE: The arch below is set to x86_64; exported artifacts will carry the
# correct arch automatically. This file is not consumed by the manifest build.
