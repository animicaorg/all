  # ruff hook temporarily omitted because multiple package-level ruff
  # configs in this monorepo use pyproject-style nested tables which the
  # standalone .ruff.toml parser can reject. We'll normalize configs and
  # re-enable ruff in pre-commit in a follow-up change.
  # Temporarily omit mypy from pre-commit to allow an initial formatting
  # pass across the monorepo. We'll add a dedicated CI mypy job later and
  # re-enable this hook after addressing the remaining typing issues.
