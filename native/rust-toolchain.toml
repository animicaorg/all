# Animica: pinned Rust toolchain for reproducible native builds.
# This file is honored by rustup and Cargo; entering the repo will auto-select
# the declared toolchain and ensure listed components are installed.

[toolchain]
# Use the latest stable toolchain. CI and local dev will converge on the same
# rustc/rustfmt versions, reducing "it works on my machine" drift.
channel = "stable"

# Keep the profile small to speed up CI bootstrap and reduce network I/O.
# (Available profiles: minimal, default, complete)
profile = "minimal"

# Ensure rustfmt is available everywhere (pre-commit hooks, CI, and editors).
# Add "clippy" here if you want linting enforced at the toolchain layer:
# components = ["rustfmt", "clippy"]
components = ["rustfmt"]

# --- Notes --------------------------------------------------------------------
# - rustup respects this file automatically. To override locally (e.g. bisect):
#     RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=1.78.0 cargo build
# - To update the stable channel (e.g. new Rust release day):
#     rustup update stable
# - If you later vendor platform targets (e.g., WASM):
#     targets = ["wasm32-unknown-unknown"]
# - For deterministic fmt in CI:
#     cargo fmt --all -- --check
