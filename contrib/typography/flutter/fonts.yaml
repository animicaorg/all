# Animica — Flutter font snippet (Inter)
# Usage:
#   1) Copy the `fonts:` block into your app's pubspec.yaml under `flutter:`.
#   2) Ensure the paths to the font assets are correct relative to pubspec.yaml.
#   3) Run `flutter pub get`.

# Example pubspec.yaml excerpt:
# flutter:
#   uses-material-design: true
#   assets:
#     # (optional) Add any token-driven JSON/CSS you want to bundle
#     - contrib/tokens/build/json/tokens.merged.json
#   fonts:
#     - family: Inter
#       fonts:
#         - asset: contrib/typography/web/inter/Inter-Variable.woff2
#           # Flutter supports woff2 as an asset; it will repackage for platforms that need TTF/OTF.
#           # If you prefer TTFs, replace with Inter TTF files and add weight ranges.
#           weight: 100
#           style: normal
#         - asset: contrib/typography/web/inter/Inter-Italic.woff2
#           weight: 100
#           style: italic

# Recommended TextTheme wiring (in code):
# final theme = ThemeData(
#   fontFamily: 'Inter',
#   textTheme: const TextTheme(
#     bodyLarge: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.w400, height: 1.5),
#     bodyMedium: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.w400, height: 1.5),
#     labelLarge: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.w500, height: 1.5),
#   ),
# );

# If you maintain per-weight TTFs, here is a TTF-based template:
# flutter:
#   fonts:
#     - family: Inter
#       fonts:
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Thin.ttf
#           weight: 100
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-ExtraLight.ttf
#           weight: 200
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Light.ttf
#           weight: 300
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf
#           weight: 400
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf
#           weight: 500
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
#           weight: 600
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf
#           weight: 700
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Black.ttf
#           weight: 900
